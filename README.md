# Variational-Autoencoders
This is the last project of the course STA414/STA2104: Statistical Methods for Machine Learning II at the University of Toronto. This project inplements the Variational Autoencoder on binarized MNIST digits according to the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) by Kingma and Welling. Neural network is used for the probabilistic encoder, hyperparameters are adjusted later to improve ELBO. More details in the Jupyter notebook.\
