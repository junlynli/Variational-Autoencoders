# Variational-Autoencoders
This project inplements the Variational Autoencoder on binarized MNIST digits according to the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf) by Kingma and Welling. Neural network is used for the probabilistic encoder, hyperparameters are adjusted later to improve ELBO.
